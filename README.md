## How timer works
The timer itself is represented as a JS class and its logic is hidden in it, so it can be used without any UI layer, just as API.
On every tick (second) the timer calls onSecondTick callback, when it ends it call onFinish callback.
Timer's tick mechanism is based on included setTimeouts and Date object. SetTimeout usually calls callback with latency (if you set 1000ms delay, it actually will be called after +-1050ms or something like that). This latency will accumulate, so timer will run a little bit longer than it must. To fix it and to do the timer more accurate, it calculates next tick interval considering drift generated by the latency. So next tick interval usually will not equal exactly 1000ms, but approximately +-950ms (but not more than 1000ms).
